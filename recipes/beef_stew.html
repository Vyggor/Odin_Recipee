        <p>What we need for our recipee</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cubed beef: you can use any cheap cut of stew meat here, such as casserole or braising steak, but don’t go for anything too lean.</li>
            <li> Red wine: don’t bother using expensive red wine unless you have some leftover. Cheap medium-dry wine will do the job just as well.</li>
            <li> Beef broth (stock) – I use Knorr stockpots but a stock cube is fine too</li>
            <li> Shallots or onion</li>
            <li> Garlic</li>
            <li> Chopped (tinned) tomatoes and tomato purée or paste. Fresh tomatoes can also be used if you prefer.</li>
            <li> Bay leaves, cinnamon stick and cloves bring on the distinctive aroma that will make your house smell amazing!</li>
            <li> A little sugar to cut the acidity – you can also use sweetener of your choice or leave this out.</li>
            <li> If you wanted to add some extra veggies, chuck in some diced carrots and celery.</li>
        </ul>
